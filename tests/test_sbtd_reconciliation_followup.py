"""Followup lifecycle over a genuine reconciled predecessor chain.

The fixture first builds a real original -> successor codex deployment ->
verified cleanup predecessor (labeled smoke-only native doubles; 合成夹具，
不证明真实 host 部署。), then reseals deployment evidence with typed
current-state reconciliation provenance plus the verification/cleanup pair
bound over it. That is the genuine reconciled+verified+cleaned predecessor a
followup must consume: planning and every later consumer accept it while the
cited missing historical receipt stays absent, fail closed the moment that
path reappears, and never rewrite predecessor history. The centralized
immutable-stage iterator also keeps the absent missing path protected
against descendant evidence output.
