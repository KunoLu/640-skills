"""Current-state reconciliation for an interrupted migration deployment.

A confirmed migration batch can reach a state where the deployment writes and
native smoke checks genuinely completed but the cumulative deployment evidence
was never saved (interrupted process, lost buffer, crashed writer). The
historical deploy execution can no longer be proven: no receipt exists and its
exit code is unknowable. This module records exactly what CAN be proven — a
fresh, fully revalidated observation of the current state — as new, explicitly
typed deployment evidence at a new path.

Truthfulness contract (no historical fabrication):

* ``payload.reconciliation.kind`` is ``"current-state"`` and
  ``historical_execution`` is ``"unknown"``. With this metadata present, a
  ``succeeded`` status means the current postconditions were observed and
  accepted NOW; it never claims the original deployment process was observed
  to exit 0, and no new target writes occurred while reconciling.
* Every resource result is derived, never caller-supplied: ``before`` is the
  sealed phase requirement, proven by the exact retained original at the
  deterministic deploy backup path (or by planned absence, which must not
  have invented a backup); ``after`` is the freshly measured current state,
  proven equal to the deterministic declared outcome (re-rendered
  configuration, exact canonical copy source, or a validated native graph).
* The evidence window (``started_at``/``finished_at``) covers only this
  observation: fresh native smoke reports are produced inside it and no
  historical timestamps or exit codes are guessed.
* Writes are limited to fresh private smoke reports and the single new
  evidence document. The missing historical path is never written. Any failed
  check fails closed: truthful fresh smoke artifacts may remain, but no
  accepted evidence is persisted.

This producer never calls deployment writers (execute_resource,
execute_migration_deployment, build_project_graph, apply_migration, recovery
or cleanup paths) and never reseals the manifest or changes versions/pins.
