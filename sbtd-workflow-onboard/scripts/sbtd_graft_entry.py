"""Guarded native Graft MCP/hook launch seam (P1-04).

This is the only path that may start the pinned ``@nanonets/graft@0.18.0``
native MCP server or its native hook module for a selected project. It exists
because every upstream entry point (``graft mcp``, the SessionStart hook) runs
``runUpkeep`` → ``reconcileWiring`` at boot, and upstream self-maintenance is
unsafe to run unverified:

- a missing wiring stamp replays ``DEFAULT_WIRING_OPTS`` (global/mcp/hooks/
  statusline all true) onto the developer's machine-wide Codex/Gemini config;
- an older stamp replays whatever hosts/flags it recorded;
- the upstream installed hook shim dynamically searches for the highest-
  version install (baked dir, repo node_modules, ``npm root -g``) and silently
  no-ops on failure.

So this launcher gates ALL native startup, then replaces the shim:

1. ``validate_runtime`` proves the exact pinned package identity from
   metadata only (no execution): node and the CLI are nofollow ordinary
   files and the CLI resolves exactly to ``dist/cli.js`` of a real
   ``@nanonets/graft`` package whose ``package.json`` version is 0.18.0.
2. ``validate_build_scope`` proves the selected root is safe for ANY native
   launch or build, even before a graph exists (the explicit-build case):
   no graft workspace index and no workspace-parent shape the pinned
   package would federate into or migrate (its workspace build deletes the
   parent's whole ``graft/`` tree); no project ``.graft`` brain link or
   unsafe build config; a generated ``graft/`` tree of only real
   directories and ordinary single-link files (a native build writes
   ``INDEX.md``/cards/``.graph`` through whatever sits there); and no
   graph/cache/concept path value the pinned query layer joins onto the
   root that is absolute, traverses, or rides a link/hardlink. Missing
   graph, stamp and source files are valid here — native freshness handles
   absence; unsafe presence never passes. Nothing is written or repaired.
3. ``validate_project`` routes through ``validate_build_scope`` and then
   requires a complete CURRENT native wiring state: an actual built wiring
   graph (``graft/.graph/wiring.json``) and the native stamp
   (``graft/.cache/wiring-stamp.json``) whose version is exactly 0.18.0,
   whose hosts are exactly ``["agents"]``, and whose four wiring opts are
   all false. With that stamp in place the native boot-time reconcile is
   a proven no-op. A missing, unreadable, stale or foreign stamp is never
   repaired here: this path writes nothing and fails closed.
4. ``managed_environment`` builds the only environment a native child may
   see: the P1-03 scrubbed env (no GRAFT_/LLM/API credentials, no Node
   preloads, DNT on, dotenv from /dev/null), HOME/USERPROFILE/XDG roots
   pointed at a provided private temporary HOME, ``GRAFT_DIR`` pinned to the
   selected root's ``graft/`` dir, and ``CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`` forced to the
   validated root (native hooks consult it before the payload cwd).

CLI (internal; wired only by the managed wiring candidates, never by
check/plan)::

    sbtd_graft_entry.py mcp  --root ABS --node ABS --entry ABS
    sbtd_graft_entry.py hook --root ABS --node ABS --entry ABS \
        --event {session-start,prompt,post-edit,stop}
    sbtd_graft_entry.py analyze --root ABS --node ABS --entry ABS \
        {ask,map,skeleton,callers,check,grep,blast} [VALUE]

``mcp`` spawns exactly ``[node, cli, "mcp", root]`` with cwd=root behind
scoped stdio forwarding. ``analyze`` admits only the seven pinned read-only
commands above, always selects the selected root as the positional project,
forces JSON and no-refresh where native offers those flags, and has no option
surface for workspace-wide ``--dir``, LLM naming, deep builds, exports or
arbitrary native argv. The pinned native server speaks newline-delimited
JSON-RPC 2.0 on stdout only, and every host request line is gated through a
FRESH ``validate_project`` before native receives it: startup validation
alone cannot cover the graph the running child reloads when an explicit
build or the Stop hook's detached sync build replaces it on disk
(``GRAFT_NO_REFRESH`` suppresses only the child's own rebuild, not its
mtime-keyed reload of the file). A request that fails the fresh guard is
never forwarded — the host receives one fixed sanitized JSON-RPC error for
that request id, the native child is closed and terminated, and the
launcher exits 2. Native replies, notifications and request ids pass
through untouched, forwarded lines and refusal lines never share a partial
line on stdout, and host EOF, a dead child or a closed host pipe end the
session without orphaning the child or dropping a completed reply. ``hook``
reads the event payload once, and when the payload's ``cwd`` is provably
outside the declared absolute binding it exits 0 without demanding the
bound root, validating or launching anything — the single explicit no-op,
required because global hook entries fire in every project the host opens,
even after the bound project was deleted (an existing payload cwd can never
physically sit inside a missing bound root). A potentially related event
keeps the strict canonical/existing root, runtime and project proofs. Any
other payload problem is a fixed failure, never a fallback. A matching
event is forwarded as the original stdin bytes to the owned bridge
(``assets/graft-hook-entry.mjs``), which imports only the exact validated
``dist/claude/hooks.js`` and calls ``main(event)``.

Every validation failure prints one fixed sanitized line to stderr and exits
2 (argparse usage errors likewise). Before any launch, the scoped temporary
HOME's ``.graft/update-check.json`` is seeded ``{latest: null, checkedAt:
now}`` — an honest "answer unknown, checked just now" stamp that suppresses
the native detached npm updater only while that stamp stays younger than the
native 24h TTL. A native server outliving the window can still spawn the
updater, and detached grandchildren (the Stop hook's sync build) can outlive
the removed HOME and recreate the temp path; the seed is a suppression
hint, not a lifetime guarantee. The scoped temporary HOME is removed in
``finally`` whether the child exits, is signaled, or the wait is
interrupted; SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP received while waiting are forwarded to
the child and its own exit status is propagated (128+n when it dies by a
signal). There is no daemon, no retry, no auth copy and no persistent HOME
write.

Public helpers are import-safe and side-effect free (pure reads); only the
CLI creates the temporary HOME and launches children.
