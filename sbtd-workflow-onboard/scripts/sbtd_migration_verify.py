"""Read-only migration verification and deployment report acceptance.

Boundary (docs/prd/sbtd-workflow-v2-migration-runtime.md, main PRD 10.2/11):

- ``verify_migration`` consumes the explicit private manifest, apply receipt
  and deployment evidence with the strict codec, proves document IDs, raw
  bindings, closure and complete predecessor success before observing
  anything, then checks actual resources against their last completed phase
  states, every retained original backup, the private source originals, the
  approved publication projections and the declared cleanup candidates. It
  never writes projects, HOME or the vault, never deploys, runs no smoke and
  performs no receipt discovery; the sealed verification is returned inside
  the read-only envelope for the authorized caller to store privately.
- ``validate_deployment_reports`` re-validates the native validation-evidence
  v1/v2 envelopes and their raw runner reports for one supplied deployment
  project record. The caller owns actual project Git and filesystem truth;
  this helper only checks the supplied scope facts against readable,
  checksum-matching report references bound to the current deployment
  attempt. A passing native envelope alone is not acceptance: the current
  attempt window, the raw API smoke exit status, the project root/ref/HEAD
  binding, the verified environment and the non-mock mode are all checked.
  JSON shape or hash equality is never execution or host authenticity proof,
  and fixture-based checks never prove a real deployment happened.
