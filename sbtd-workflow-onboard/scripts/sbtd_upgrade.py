"""Onboard upgrade alignment engine: sealed plans, guarded apply, verify, recovery.

This module owns the upgrade core. ``sbtd_upgrade_inventory`` builds the
payload baseline and skill/AGENTS resources, ``sbtd_upgrade_hosts`` builds,
renders and verifies host (MCP/shell) resources, and ``sbtd_upgrade_cli``
owns the public CLI envelope. Everything here returns JSON-safe
dictionaries; refusals raise the existing sanitized ``ContractError``.

Two digest families are kept strictly separate:

- Semantic (payload) states come only from the inventory module's
  ``payload_directory_state`` / ``payload_file_state`` helpers. They are
  stable under cache churn and seal plans, receipts, intents and recovery
  expectations; they decide drift, alignment and retry reconciliation.
- Mechanical states are fresh ``sbtd_migration_files.snapshot`` results
  taken immediately before each primitive call and passed as ``expected``
  to ``backup_reference`` / ``install_reference`` / ``write_file`` /
  ``remove_reference``. The two families are never compared to each other.

Security semantics, by design:

- A plan seals the baseline, the canonical scope (normalized once through
  the inventory provider's strict ``normalize_scope``: checked absolute
  paths with their literal spelling, canonical host platforms such as
  oh-my-pi -> omp), the private backup
  root and every resource identity. The ``plan_id`` binds one confirmation
  to that sealed set; it is not authentication and never authorizes
  arbitrary paths.
- Apply re-derives resource identities from the sealed scope and the
  current validated sources. A self-consistent plan whose resources were
  edited and re-hashed (paths, desired content, source pins) is rejected
  as plan-stale; the sealed skill/AGENTS decision must also match the
  documented classification/decision rule, so flipping a preserve into a
  replace requires editing the user's own scope decisions, which the
  confirmation binds.
- Every mutation batch runs in an isolated subprocess executed from a
  complete staged copy of the current package inside the private vault.
  The staged copy is digest-bound to the sealed baseline source state, so
  the running package may itself be an upgrade target without ever
  lazy-importing a mixed old/new module set. Host rendering keeps its
  anchor at the real package root; rendered configuration never points
  into the vault.
- The whole resource set is preflighted (overlap, vault disjointness,
  live before-states, complete original backups) before the first write.
  Each write is preceded by an immutable persisted intent and followed by
  a measured after-state and an immutable cumulative receipt. Original
  backups are never destroyed by the engine.
- Retry skips only resources whose live state matches the prior receipt's
  recorded after-state. An interruption between a write and its receipt
  is reconciled from the persisted intent and the measured live state,
  never claimed unwritten; unknown live state is rejected.
- Recovery covers only resources this batch actually changed, re-seals
  the current after-state, requires its own confirmation, refuses live
  drift (unknown changes are never overwritten) and restores backups
  without deleting them.
- A failure escaping the mutation region (intent/receipt persistence or an
  isolated executor crash) is re-raised with ``details["batch"]`` binding
  the plan or recovery identity, the private backup root, the latest
  trusted checkpoint receipt path and the measured-or-unknown mutation
  state. The bound checkpoint is recovery evidence, never the failed
  attempt's success; pre-write validation failures carry no batch evidence
  and keep the plain pre-write blocked surface.
- Verify is read-only: managed skill/AGENTS payload state is measured
  semantically against the sealed desired states, while MCP/shell disk,
  runtime, host and legacy evidence comes from ``verify_hosts`` as a
  separate dimension — a user adding unrelated configuration after the
  upgrade stays aligned, ownership drift still fails. A preserve
  exception always prevents a complete-aligned result, and without an
  explicit probe no host loading is claimed.

No cross-domain atomic transaction is claimed: resources are written one
at a time with per-resource receipts.
